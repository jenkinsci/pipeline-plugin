/**
 * Marks a flow build as entering a gated “stage”, like a stage in a pipeline.
 * Each job has a set of named stages, each of which acts like a semaphore with an initial permit count,
 * but with the special behavior that only one build may be waiting at any time: the newest.
 * Credit goes to @jtnord for implementing the {@code block} operator in {@code buildflow-extensions}, which inspired this.
