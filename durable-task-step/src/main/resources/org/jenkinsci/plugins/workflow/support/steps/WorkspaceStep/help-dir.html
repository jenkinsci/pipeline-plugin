<p>
    A workspace is automatically allocated for you with the <code>node</code> step,
    or you can get an alternate workspace with this <code>ws</code> step,
    but by default the location is chosen automatically.
    (Something like <code>SLAVE_ROOT/workspace/JOB_NAME@2</code>.)
</p>
<p>
    You can instead specify a path here and that workspace will be locked instead.
    (The path may be relative to the slave root, or absolute.)
</p>
<p>
    If concurrent builds ask for the same workspace, a directory with a suffix such as <code>@2</code> may be locked instead.
    Currently there is no option to wait to lock the exact directory requested;
    if you need to enforce that behavior, you can either fail (<code>error</code>) when <code>pwd</code> indicates that you got a different directory,
    or you may enforce serial execution of this part of the build by some other means such as <code>stage name: '…', concurrency: 1</code>.
</p>
<p>
    If you do not care about locking, just use the <code>dir</code> step to change current directory.
