* [JENKINS-26163](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-26163): `AbstractStepExecutionImpl.onResume` was not (usually) being called for block-scoped steps, leading to incorrect behavior after Jenkins restart for flows inside `timeout` or `waitUntil`.

* [JENKINS-26129](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-26129): Experimental support for multibranch workflows. (For now, in a separate plugin, not included in _Workflow: Aggregator_, since it depends on the Branch API plugin which does not have a non-beta release and so is available only from the experimental update center.)

* [JENKINS-25938](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-25938): avoid creating a Java (native) thread for every executor (flow build or `node {}` block).
* [JENKINS-22941](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-22941): allow Jenkins safe restart to proceed even while a flow build is running, so long as it is just waiting (for an external process, `waitUntil`, etc.).
* [JENKINS-26900](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-26900): hide the “flyweight” executor on master corresponding to the flow build when it is just waiting.

## 1.5 (Apr 01 2015)

* Now based on Jenkins core 1.596.1.
* [JENKINS-27531](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-27531): critical startup error in 1.597+ loading build records migrated from before 1.597.
* [JENKINS-27695](https://issues.jenkins-ci.org/browse/JENKINS-27695): critical error in 1.607+ running `node` blocks.
