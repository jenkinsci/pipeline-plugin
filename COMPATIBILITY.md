# Plugin Compatibility with Pipeline

For architectural reasons, plugins providing various extensions of interest to builds cannot be made automatically compatible with Pipeline.
Typically they require use of some newer APIs, large or small (see the bottom of this document for details).
This document captures the ongoing status of plugins known to be compatible or incompatible.

Entries list the class name serving as the entry point to the relevant functionality of the plugin (generally an `@Extension`), the plugin short name, and implementation status.

Newly filed issues should bear the label `pipeline` for ease of tracking.
