<div>
    Name of a downstream job to build.
    May be another Pipeline job, but more commonly a freestyle or other project.
    Use a simple name if the job is in the same folder as this upstream Pipeline job;
    otherwise can use relative paths like <code>../sister-folder/downstream</code>
    or absolute paths like <code>/top-level-folder/nested-folder/downstream</code>.
